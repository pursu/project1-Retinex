# project1-Retinex
This code is the implement of Retinex algorithm in Python 3.5.

This code can be used in the images, which are **foggy** or with **insufficient brightness**.

# The test Environment of the code
  **Ubuntu 16.04**
  
  
  **Python 3.5**
  
  
  **Numpy**
  
  
  **Opencv 3.2.0**


# run Demo
You can directly run the **run_single.py**.

You will get the results in **testdata**

The orgin images are in **data**.

# Use your own data
You just put your own images in **data**.

Then run **run_multiprocess.py** or **run_single.py**

Finally, you can get the results in **testdata**
# Note
The run_multiprocess.py is implemented by multiprocess in Python, which can imporve the speed in processsing Large number of pictures
